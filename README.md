# ðŸ“† Booking Calendar App â€“ Technical Test

This project is a calendar-based booking viewer built using **Vue 3**, **Nuxt 3**, and **TypeScript**.

---

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack

- **Vue 3** + **Nuxt 3** â€“ Application framework
- **TypeScript** â€“ Type safety
- **TailwindCSS** â€“ Utility-first styling
- **Pinia** â€“ Reactive state management
- **Vitest** â€“ Unit testing
- **Day.js** â€“ Date manipulation (wrapped in a utility abstraction)

## Notes

**UI Design**

I put minimal effort into visual styling. The focus was on building a working and logically sound UI using TailwindCSS.

**Date Management**

Used Day.js, wrapped in a local abstraction layer (utils/date.ts) for flexibility and future swap-out potential.

**Calendar Rendering**

The calendar was custom-implemented for demonstration. In a production environment, a solution like FullCalendar could be considered.

**Architecture Approach**

Applied a modular, domain-based architecture:

```bash
components/: UI layer
stores/: state/data management
services/: business logic (e.g., booking filters, calendar generation)
api/: decoupled API layer
```
